<div class="definition">
  <summary>topology</summary>
  Let $X$ be a set, and let a family $\mathcal T \subseteq \mathcal P$. $\mathcal T$ is called a topology on $X$ iff

  1. $\emptyset, X \in \mathcal T$;
  2. $\mathcal T$ is closed under arbitrary union;
  3. $\mathcal T$ is closed under finite intersection.
